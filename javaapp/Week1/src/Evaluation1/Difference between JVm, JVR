JDK
1.JDK is primarily used for code execution and has prime functionality of development.
2.JDK is platform dependent i.e for different platforms different JDK required.
3.As JDK is responsible for prime development so it contains tools for developing, debugging and monitoring java application.
4.JDK = Java Runtime Environment (JRE) + Development tools

JRE

1.On other hand JRE is majorly responsible for creating environment for code execution.
2.Like of JDK JRE is also platform dependent.
3.On other hand JRE does not contain tools such as compiler or debugger etc. Rather it contains class libraries and other supporting files that JVM requires to run the program.
4.JRE = Java Virtual Machine (JVM) + Libraries to run the application

JVM

1.JVM on other hand specifies all the implementations and responsible to provide these implementations to JRE.
2.JVM is platform independent.
3.JVM does not include software development tools.
4.JVM = Only Runtime environment for executing the Java byte code.
